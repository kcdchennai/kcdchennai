**Kubernetes Community Days Chennai (KCD Chennai)** is a community-organized, not-for-profit event that gathers adopters and technologists from open source and cloud native communities for education, collaboration, and networking. KCDs are supported by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). These fun, locally-defined events help grow and sustain the Kubernetes and Cloud Native community.

KCD Chennai 2023 is a 1-day, in-person conference that brings together professionals, developers, vendors, end-users, industry experts and analysts to share their experience and learn from others’ experience in building and operating large-scale cloud-native software systems. The participants get to connect with like-minded peers from different organizations.
